        <h1>CURRENT SOCCER</h1>
        <p>Soccer is a very eccentric game with each position an important asset to the team. Each position is like a gear in a clock, without one the whole won’t work. It is essential to their team that they are coordinated so they can win. The 2022 world cup is scheduled from November to December, and is certain to be one for the books as we have many young stars playing from all over the world.

          <p>Playing sports of any kind requires an eye for details so you can make the most out of every situation. That is one reason why soccer is one of the best sports in the world. The fluidity of the game means that there will be little or no occasional stops and distractions during the gameplay. Instead, both the clock/timing and the ball are in motion at all times. If for any reason the ball goes out of play, it will be put right back to play the next minute.
