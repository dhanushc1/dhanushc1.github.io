      <p >NBA season is very fast paced with games almost every day excluding the summer which is the off season. In 2022, all the teams played exceptionally and had some fascinating game play and will go down as a year to remember. The two teams who topped the others were the Boston Celtics and the Golden State Warriors. The Boston Celtics, who were the obvious underdogs, quickly surprised everyone and won against the Warriors by 12 points in their first game, but the Warriors came back swiftly and mopped the floor with the Celtics, with an astonishing 19 point victory. The cycle went on for the next two games with the Celtics winning game three, and Warriors winning game 4. It was in game 5 where the Warriors turned things around and beat the Celtics by ten points. Game 6 is set to start on June 16 2022, and game 7 on June 19 2022. For more current updates check
