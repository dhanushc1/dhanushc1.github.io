        <p>Baseball is one of the most unique sports. There are many things about baseball that make it unique. It’s the only one of America’s big four sports (baseball, basketball, football, & hockey) where the defense possesses the ball. It’s the only game where a player is not allowed to reenter the game once he’s removed. Baseball is an eccentric sport and no obstacle is big enough for a comeback in baseball
