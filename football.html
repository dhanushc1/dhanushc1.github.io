        <h1 >CURRENT AMERICAN FOOTBALL</h1>
        <p>Football doesn't have many games, 
          but along with that they are very physically demanding with
           ramming into huge people and running huge lengths. In 2022, the
            Rams faced the Bengals. The game faced many twists and turns and at the end, the Rams came out as the victors. Cooper Kupp, the Ramâ€™s wide receiver, won the finals MVP. For more current information check out
